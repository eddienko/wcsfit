The configure script takes a number of arguments. Doing:

% ./configure --help

will give you a list. The most important are:

(1) --with-cfitsio and --with-wcs Use these to specify the path to the
    cfitsio and wcslib distributions. (Usually something like /usr/local).

(2) --prefix Use this to specify where you want the binaries to be installed.
    If you say nothing they will be installed in the top level of the 
    distribution tree in a directory called 'bin'. You then have to make
    sure to include this in your PATH.

An example installation of my own is the following:

% gunzip -c casutools-1.0.30.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

% cd casutools-1.0.30

% ./configure --with-cfitsio=/usr/local --with-wcs=/usr/local
<Lots of output....>

% make
<Lots more output...>

% make install
<More output>

% ls
aclocal.m4	 config.h.in	 configure.ac  Makefile     README
autom4te.cache/  config.log	 depcomp*      Makefile.am  src/
bin/		 config.status*  install-sh*   Makefile.in  stamp-h1

% ls bin
classify*  grout*   imcore_list*  mosaic*     ungrout*    wcsfit*

================================================================================
20141103:
          Tagged as v1.0.30

          Modified wcsfit.c so that there is now a magnitude cut in the 
          standard star list if there are too many.

20140808: 
          Tagged as v1.0.29

          Added the nbsize <= 0 option to imcore_list

20140731: 
          Tagged as v1.0.28

          Fixed imcore so that nbsize <= 0 gives a constant background.
          Also fixed long standing problem in imcore_list where the 
          equatorial coordinates in the output catalogue are in degrees
          rather than radians as advertised

20140718:
          Tagged as v1.0.27

          The ell file in imcore_list now places the objects at the original
          coordinate location rather than in the location where the detection
          algorithm _thinks_ there might be an object.

20140610:
          wcsfit now checks to see if there are any rows in the input
          catalogue. If there aren't then we just get a non-fatal 
          error message and moves onto the next extension.

20130530: 
	  Tagged as v1.0.26

	  Fixed bug in vstpickup_main.c affecting one of the error
	  messages.

	  Added vstfix

	  Removed extraneous declaration in casu_wcs.h

20130207:
	  Tagged as v1.0.25

	  Fixed bug in the projection part of the WCS routines in 
	  cir_imstack_cat.c and cir_mosaic.c which was caused by crpix
	  being exact integers

20121208:
	  Tagged as v1.0.24
20121207:  
	  Added vstpickup

20121205:
          Fixed cir_classify so that it traps for WFCAM data and modifies
	  the moffat profile exponent. Also fixed grout and ungrout so that
	  you can't accidently repeat the procedure

20121001:
	  Tagged as v1.0.23

20121001:
	  Fixed bug in cir_mosaic affecting zeropoint. Fixed duplicate
	  column names in imcore create_table_1.c

20120904: Tagged as v1.0.22

20120904: Fixed small memory leak in mosaic

20120813:
          Fixed a bug in imcore_main that causes the routine to barf if
	  the output file doesn't have a filename extension (eg .fit). Fixed
	  outloc in cir_imstack_cat and cir_mosaic so that the zpn is 
	  calculated correctly. Added PPMXL to list of astrometric 
	  catalogues in wcsfit.

20120720:
	  Fixed a bug in some of the sort routines

20120509: 
	  Fixed nebuliser so that any tables in the input FITS file just
	  get copied to the output file. Also stole some code from ESO so
	  that the autoconf now checks whether cfitsio has been configured
	  for threads.

20120119: Tagged as v1.0.21

20120119: Added new ungrout routine

20120104:
          Fixed aperture correction routines ap67 and ap0 in cir_classify to
	  provide sensible minimum values of sigma

20111105:
	  Fixed small bug in cir_imstack_cat.c in calculation of overlap region

20111101:
          Added tabtag to create_table.c in imcore. This creates a keyword
	  called CATTYPE in the primary that tells you which catalogue
	  type option was used when imcore was run

20110916: Tagged as v1.0.20

20110916: Fixed scaling bug in cir_imstack_cat.c
	  Added code to cir_getstds to weed out entries outside the
	  defined box, which helps greatly near the poles

20110627: Tagged as v1.0.19

20110627: imstack now takes input files that are simple FITS images. The
	  limitation is that all input images must be either simple or MEF --
	  we can't mix the two.

20110609: Tagged as v1.0.18

20110609: nebuliser now adds keyword NEBULSED to output headers. Fixed a 
	  small bug in wcsopen to deal with the situation where no 
	  WCS has been parsed. grout now adds keywords in the primary header
	  that tell something about the QC of the pawprints that went
	  into the tile.

20110214: Tagged as v1.0.17

20110214: Fixed bug in cir_classify which affected the calculation of
	  the curvature of the stellar locus

20110211: Tagged as v1.0.16

20110211: Fixed memory bug in grout_main.c

20110205: Tagged as v1.0.15

20110203: Fixed minor bug imcore create_table_6.c to cater for old style
	  FITS WCS keywords.

20110131: Modifications to grout to add MJD info to catalogues and allow the
	  creation of an MJD map. Modified casu_wcs.c again to fix parsing bug
	  for wfcam catalogue headers.

20110121: Tagged as v1.0.13

20110119: Fixed options menu in headers of some main routines. Fixed small
	  bug in cir_classify.c to get position angle in range [0,180].

20110118: Small tweak to cir_classify.c

20110114: Tagged as v1.0.12

20110114: Small modifications to cir_classify.c to remove a small chance of
	  a seg fault. casu_wcs.c modified so that wcslib opens headers in a
	  different way for tables and images

20110112: Modified classify to do a better job on some aperture corrections and
	  to output a median position angle. Bug fixed in grout which could
	  cause NULL values in the output table. Other smaller bugs fixed.

20101210: Modified imcore_background.c so that the routine backstats does a
	  better job of working out the statistics in the case of an image
	  with high background counts and low noise.

20101123: Tagged as v1.0.11

20101123: Added classify

20101122: Tagged as v1.0.10

20101122: Added dribble and grout

20101102: Tagged as v1.0.9

20101002: Fixed the way nebuliser opens its output files as the previous
	  version didn't like changing data types.

20101101: Tagged as v1.0.8

20101101: Fixed bug in imcore_main_list which affected noconf option. Fixed
	  misc.c so that creating a file copies the template data over in
	  cases where the array sizes haven't changed. Fixed long standing
	  bug in imcore_list where position errors can be null.

20101029: Tagged as v1.0.7

20101029: Changed how provenance is added to headers so that directory
	  names are stripped off. Also fixed bug in provenance routines
	  to stop keyword values from being overrun by extra long filenames

20101005: A few simple fixes to imcore routines to remove the chance of 
	  uninitialised values being accessed. Also modified cir_wcsopen to
	  use a different wcslib parsing routine.

20101001: Tagged as v1.0.6

20101001: Added NICOMB header keywords to output of imstack

20100921: Added verbose output to nebuliser and mosaic. Fixed bug in mosaic
	  affecting the reading of confidence maps when only 1 is present.
	  Forced output images from nebuliser to be both uncompressed and 
	  floating point even if the input is integer.

20100920: Fixed memory leak in imstack 

20100919: tagged as version 1.0.5

20100919: Fixed a bug affecting nebuliser. Added section in imstack_main to 
	  deal with missing extensions. Fixed a few typos.

20100906: tagged as version 1.0.4

20100906: Tidied up some documentation

20100905: Added nebuliser and mosaic applications

20100827: Made changes in imcore to allow NBSIZE to be written to output
	  headers

20100806: tagged as version 1.0.3

20100806: Fixed dodgy calloc in imcore_overlp and wrote workaround to problem
	  with wcspih. 

20100805: tagged as version 1.0.2

20100805: Fixed bug in wcsfit so that simple FITS images are dealt with
	  properly

20100802: tagged as version 1.0.1

20100730: Modifications to automake files. System includes modified to
	  help with build on Mac.

20100729: Mods to imcore source to fix headers in tables that come from 
	  images that are simple FITS files. Basically the header of the 
	  image wasn't being copied to the table extension of the catalogue.
	  Fixed bug that arose when the "noconf" option is used. Fixed spacing
	  in some Makefile.am files.

20100127: Version 1.0.0 released
