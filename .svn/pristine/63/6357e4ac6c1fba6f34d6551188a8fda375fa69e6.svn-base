    ---------
    
    201611 (TODO)
    
     - Better handling of cases with no stars or not enough stars
     - When fitting affine transformation provide estimation on success before 
       updating a solution
     - When fitting PV provide estimation on success before updating a solution
     
    
    201610
    
     - Nearest neighbour distribution used to compute optimum match radius.
     - Polynomial of distortion defined to have 12 elements per axis (3 degrees). 
       Added option to change it when initializing.
     - Added check of astrometry RMS in order to end iteration.
     - Removed need for wcsfit from casutools. Dependency on imcore still present.
       Probably needs some bug squishing for cases with no stars in detector, etc.
     - Reworked most of the run_wcsfit function.
     - Allow to fit full astrometric model for dense fields removing the need of
       using SCAMP.
     - Added CCDImage class to drive the fitting
     - Dropped support for running in quadrants only.
     - Dropped multithreading support.

CLASSES
    __builtin__.object
        CCDImage
    
    class CCDImage(__builtin__.object)
     |  Class to deal with astrometry of Euclid CCD images.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __enter__(self)
     |  
     |  __exit__(self, type, value, traceback)
     |  
     |  __init__(self, image_name, mode='readonly', save_backup=False, npv=12)
     |      Initialize the class. Note that errors are not fully handled, i.e., 
     |      it is the user responsability to feed a valid FITS file.
     |  
     |  add_astrometric_distortion(self, config)
     |      Add astrometric distortion model to the header. This function reads the 
     |      astrometric model (i.e. PV keywords) from a configuration file and updates
     |      the header accordingly.
     |  
     |  close(self)
     |  
     |  fill_coords(self)
     |      Calculates RA and DEC coordinates from X and Y and stores in catalogue.
     |      This step is necessary if the RA, DEC coordinates are needed after a run
     |      of imcore.
     |      
     |      Currently this is a convenience function if one needs to work with the
     |      catalogue generated by imcore elsewhere. It is not used in the fitting
     |      procedure.
     |  
     |  find_stars(self)
     |      Find stars on image.
     |  
     |  fit_astrometry(self, refcat=None, wcsconf='wcsfit.conf', makecat=True, fitpv=False)
     |      Covenience function to run all commands to fit the astrometry to an 
     |      image.
     |      
     |      Arguments
     |      ---------
     |      
     |      reference_catalogue: name of the catalogue containing reference stars
     |      makecat: if True create a catalogue
     |      fitpv: fit the model distortion coefficients
     |  
     |  init_astrometry(self, centre='ccd', more_keys=False)
     |      Initialise the astrometric keywords in the headers and optionally allocate space for more keywords.
     |      This function only moves the reference point to the centre of each CCD. See function
     |      add_astrometric_distortion to add the astrometric model.
     |      
     |      Arguments
     |      ---------
     |      
     |      centre: location of the reference point. Either in the centre of each CCD or in the centre of the FPA.
     |  
     |  read_catalogue(self, catalogue_name=None)
     |      Read image catalogue.
     |  
     |  update_model(self, config='wcsfit.conf')
     |  
     |  wcsfit(self, refcat=None, niter=12, fitpv=False, maxstars=None, tol=0.0001)
     |      Fit astrometry model.
     |      
     |      Arguments
     |      ---------
     |      
     |      refcat: reference astrometric catalogue
     |      
     |      niter: number of iterations to perform
     |      
     |      fitpv: if True refine the astrometric model.
     |      
     |      maxstars: maximum number of reference stars used for the match 
     |      
     |      tol: tolerance value to stop iteration loop
     |  
     |  writeto(self, output, **kwargs)
